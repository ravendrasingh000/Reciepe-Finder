Recipe Maker is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the goal of helping users easily manage their own recipes. Users can add a new recipe with its name and calories, edit or delete existing ones, and mark any recipe as a favorite using the star button. All data is stored in the browser using Local Storage, ensuring that recipes remain saved even after refreshing the page. The project also includes a search bar where users can filter recipes instantly. For example, typing “sugar” will only show sugar-related recipes.

The application also works as a basic calorie tracker, because when a recipe is added to favorites, its calories are automatically counted in the Total Calories section. This makes the app more practical and interactive. Through this project, key concepts like DOM manipulation, CRUD operations, local storage usage, and search filtering in JavaScript were implemented. The design is kept clean and user-friendly to give a smooth experience.
